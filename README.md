# OCT Retinal Disease Classification using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements an **AI-assisted retinal OCT analysis platform** that classifies Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into four clinically relevant categories: **CNV, DME, DRUSEN, and NORMAL**.

A **MobileNetV3-based deep learning model**, trained on a large, expert-labeled OCT dataset, is integrated into a **Streamlit web application**. Users can upload an OCT scan and receive an instant prediction along with clinically interpretable recommendations.  
The system is designed as a **decision-support and academic demonstration tool**, not as a standalone diagnostic system.
